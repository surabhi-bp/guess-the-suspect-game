    <h1>üîé The Truth Revealed</h1>

    <p>
      It was <strong>{{ killer }}</strong> all along.
    </p>

    <p>
      {{ killer }} had the perfect opportunity and motive. While others were preoccupied during dinner, {{ killer }} discreetly laced Harold Doyle‚Äôs wine glass with poison ‚Äî not the bottle, just the glass. This detail was confirmed by the forensic team.
    </p>

    <p>
      The motive? A deep and long-held grudge. Years ago, Harold had manipulated the will of the family estate, cutting {{ killer }} out of their rightful inheritance. {{ killer }} kept up appearances at the manor all these years, quietly waiting for the perfect moment. The annual dinner, where everyone raised a glass in toast, offered the ideal setting for a murder that could be disguised as a heart attack ‚Äî silent, undetectable, and in front of everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      During questioning, {{ killer }} kept calm but gave away subtle inconsistencies ‚Äî forgetting details, deflecting questions, or overly blaming others. The truth was there, buried beneath their lies.
